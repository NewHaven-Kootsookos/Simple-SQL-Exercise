# Simple SQL Exercise

In this exercise, learners/lecturers will write queries that create a database and a simple table in that database. Learners will then test their queries by pushing them to their GitHub repo and checking the output from automated tests.

1. In `SimpleDB`, create a table called `customers` that has attributes for customer name and address.

    | customers |

    | customerId |
    | cust_name |
